# Previous Versions of Activiti

The heart of the Activiti projects is the process engine and the engine in v7 is fundamentally much the same as in v6. The difference is that v7 provides new ways to use it.

Users who are used to the spring-boot-starter-basic (see http://www.baeldung.com/spring-activiti) will find the same possibilities in activiti-cloud-starter-configure. In addition Activiti Cloud also provides new starters to support bootstrapping a set of microservices to quickly create a scalable cloud architecture.

## Maintenance of Old Versions

Activiti 6 is being actively maintained and we will review pull requests on previous versions on a case-by-case basis.
