# RC1

In this release we included pretty big changes and refinements. We are now running with JDK 11 and we included the next iteration for our GraphQL based notification service. We did refine a lot of APIs in our Runtime Bundle and Query services to support more scenarios. We are going to go fast to GA and we will concentrate on refine and test the core features. We encourage community members to test the released artifacts and report back any issues that you might find to [here](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/).

If you find any issues with RC1 please create an [issue here](https://github.com/activiti/activiti/issues). Or get in touch [via Gitter](https://gitter.im/Activiti/Activiti7?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link).

We will be aiming for [GA](https://github.com/activiti/activiti/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3ARC1) by mid February [track progress here](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/milestone/18).

This is a great time to get involved to help us with the Beta testing process, integrating with your favourite Open Source projects and learning about the technology stack that we are using to build these amazing tools. If you are ready for a big challenge get in touch [via Gitter](https://gitter.im/Activiti/Activiti7?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link).

## Consuming RC1 Docker Images

Docker images are published at [https://hub.docker.com/u/activiti/](https://hub.docker.com/u/activiti/) under the `7.0.0.RC1` tag.

For deployment to Kubernetes, Helm charts are provided in [https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts) and these can be consumed using the [https://activiti.github.io/activiti-cloud-charts/](https://activiti.github.io/activiti-cloud-charts/) charts repository, as suggested in [Getting Started with Activiti Cloud](https://activiti.gitbook.io/activiti-7-developers-guide/getting-started/getting-started-activiti-cloud)

With RC1 the charts version was upgraded to to 0.7.x

## Migration of Projects Built on Beta5

The version of maven aritfact `activiti-cloud-dependencies` should be upgraded to `7.0.0.RC1`
This release works on JDK 11 so you will need to have JDK 11 in order to use these artifacts. 

Our example projects, were updated to to use spring boot start parent: 
```
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0.RELEASE</version>
    <relativePath/> 
  </parent>
```
To inherit plugins coming from the parent instead of using BOM dependency management. 
We also added JAXB into our example runtime bundle, due JAXB removed from JDK11 as an optional module
```
 <dependency>
    <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>
    <version>${javax.xml.bind.version}</version>
  </dependency>
```

with the version:
```
<javax.xml.bind.version>2.3.0</javax.xml.bind.version>
```

If you are using Docker, we switched to use:

```
FROM openjdk:11.0-jdk-slim
```

### Known issues

Currently Spring HATEOAS output for Activiti Cloud services is incorrectly showing cluster-internal URLs for self links. This is a bug in Spring HATEOAS for which the fix has not yet been released \(at the time of writing\). We expect this issue to go away when we upgrade to Spring Cloud Greenwich.RELEASE.
