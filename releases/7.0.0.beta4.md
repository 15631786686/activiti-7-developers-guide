# Beta4

You can find the [full list of Beta4 issues here](https://github.com/Activiti/Activiti/milestone/16?closed=1)

Beta4 included an upgrade to Spring Boot 2.1. For any applications built on Spring Boot 2.0.x, it is recommended to upgrade Spring Boot along with Activiti 7 version.

Currently hateos output for Activiti Cloud services is incorrectly showing cluster-internal URLs for self links. This is a bug in Spring hateos for which the fix has not yet been released (at the time of writing).

You can find the published Beta4 artifacts in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.activiti.cloud.dependencies/activiti-cloud-dependencies/7.0.0.Beta4/pom)  and the tagged [Docker Images in Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/activiti/).

Also our HELM charts ([activiti-cloud-full-example](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts/tree/master/activiti-cloud-full-example) version 0.5.0) were upgraded to use Beta4 Docker Images.

If you find any issues with Beta4 please create an [issue here](https://github.com/activiti/activiti/issues).
Or get in touch [via Gitter](https://gitter.im/Activiti/Activiti7?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link). 

We will be aiming for [Beta5](https://github.com/activiti/activiti/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3ABeta5) by the end of December and you can [track progress here](https://github.com/activiti/activiti/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3ABeta5). 


This is a great time to get involved to help us with the Beta testing process, integrating with your favourite Open Source projects and  learning about the technology stack that we are using to build these amazing tools. If you are ready for a big challenge get in touch [via Gitter](https://gitter.im/Activiti/Activiti7?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link). 

## Consuming Beta4 Docker Images

As with Beta3, Docker images are published at https://hub.docker.com/u/activiti/ under the `7.0.0.Beta4` tag.

For deployment to Kubernetes, Helm charts are provided in https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts and these can be consumed using the https://activiti.github.io/activiti-cloud-charts/ charts repository, as suggested in https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts/blob/master/activiti-cloud-full-example/README.md

With Beta4 the charts version moved to 0.5.x

To enable the modeling UI, add:

```
activiti-cloud-modeling:
  enabled: true
```

To the myvalues.yaml file used for deployment of the full example. Access the modeling UI on the `/activiti-cloud-modeling` path of the gateway host.

## Migration of Projects Built on Beta3

The version of maven aritfact `activiti-cloud-dependencies` should be upgraded to `7.0.0.Beta4`
