## Consuming Beta5 Docker Images

As with Beta3, Docker images are published at [https://hub.docker.com/u/activiti/](https://hub.docker.com/u/activiti/) under the `7.0.0.Beta5` tag.

For deployment to Kubernetes, Helm charts are provided in [https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts) and these can be consumed using the [https://activiti.github.io/activiti-cloud-charts/](https://activiti.github.io/activiti-cloud-charts/) charts repository, as suggested in [https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts/blob/master/activiti-cloud-full-example/README.md](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts/blob/master/activiti-cloud-full-example/README.md)

With Beta5 the charts version moved to 0.6.x

To enable the modeling UI, add:

```text
activiti-cloud-modeling:
  enabled: true
```

To the myvalues.yaml file used for deployment of the full example. Access the modeling UI on the `/activiti-cloud-modeling` path of the gateway host.

## Migration of Projects Built on Beta4

The version of maven aritfact `activiti-cloud-dependencies` should be upgraded to `7.0.0.Beta5`

### Known issues

Currently Spring HATEOAS output for Activiti Cloud services is incorrectly showing cluster-internal URLs for self links. This is a bug in Spring HATEOAS for which the fix has not yet been released \(at the time of writing\). We expect this issue to go away when we upgrade to Spring Cloud Greenwich.RELEASE.
