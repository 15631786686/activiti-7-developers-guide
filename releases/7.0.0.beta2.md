# Beta2

## What Is Included In Beta2?

Beta2 adds the first version of the modeling UI, built on Angular. This can be used to design and export process definitions and applications, which can then be run in Activiti 7 runtime bundles.

## Consuming Beta2 Docker Images

As with Beta1, Docker images are published at [https://hub.docker.com/u/activiti/](https://hub.docker.com/u/activiti/) under the `7.0.0.Beta2` tag.

For deployment to Kubernetes, Helm charts are provided in [https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts) and these can be consumed using the [https://activiti.github.io/activiti-cloud-charts/](https://activiti.github.io/activiti-cloud-charts/) charts repository, as suggested in [https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts/blob/master/activiti-cloud-full-example/README.md](https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts/blob/master/activiti-cloud-full-example/README.md)

With Beta2 the charts version moved to 0.3.x

To enable the modeling UI, add:

```text
activiti-cloud-modeling:
  enabled: true
```

To the myvalues.yaml file used for deployment of the full example. Access the modeling UI on the `/activiti-cloud-modeling` path of the gateway host.
