# Beta2

## What Is Included In Beta2?

Beta2 adds the first version of the modeling UI, built on Angular. This can be used to design and export process definitions and applications, which can then be run in Activiti 7 runtime bundles.

## Consuming Beta2 Docker Images

As with Beta1, Docker images are published at https://hub.docker.com/u/activiti/ under the `7.0.0.Beta2` tag.

For deployment to Kubernetes, Helm charts are provided in https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts and these can be consumed using the https://activiti.github.io/activiti-cloud-charts/ charts repository, as suggested in https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-charts/blob/master/activiti-cloud-full-example/README.md

To enable the modeling UI, add:

```
activiti-cloud-modeling:
  enabled: true
```

To the myvalues.yaml file used for deployment of the full example. Access the modeling UI on the `/activiti-cloud-modeling` path of the gateway host.
